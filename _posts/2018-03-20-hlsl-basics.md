## Summary
Unity Shaders are written in a custom environment called "Shaderlab". With it we can customize a lot about how the material that will use our shader will be used internally. Inside of the shaderlab file we will also declare most of the logic of the shader in HLSL. Because Shaderlab is just a way to set some parameters in the material it's pretty easy to learn how to set which parameter when we need it. HLSL is a bit more complex though so I'll explain some of it's basics here. Even though I try to explain everything in this tutorials, I sadly can't explain every basic programming principle so I recommend you learn a different programming language before coming back to shaders.

Because this is the first tutorial in this series I tried to make it as simple as possible, if I failed to do that and assumed that you know things about shaders that you don't, please contact me. In that case I'll fix the tutorial to be more approachable. If the information in this tutorial is clear, but you have difficulties grasping the concepts because it's all a bit theoretical, feel free to jump to the next tutorials where we will use the concepts in praxis which might make things clearer.

## Variables
HLSL is a statically typed language, that means that each variable has a specific data type which has to be explicitely stated and can’t change. I'll quickly go some of the types here, if you want more information you can look at this page of the unity documentation: <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-DataTypesAndPrecision.html>

### Scalar Types
The simplest variable types are scalar numbers, they have a single numeric value. There are multiple Types of scalar numbers in HLSL. Choosing a lower precision value can improve the performance of your shaders, but modern graphics cards are pretty fast so the differences will be small. I use floats often in my shaders where half or fixed variables would be enough so use your own judgement and don't overthink it.

- Integer numbers have no fractional part. Because we will mostly manipulate numbers and positions, integer numbers are much less common in graphic programming and especially shaders than numbers with fractional parts, but they're still oten useful, for example as indices when we're working with arrays.
- Fixed point numbers are the lowest precision numbers in unity shaders. They can hold values from -2 to +2 and always have 265 steps between whole values. They are great for colors, because colors are also often only stored in 256 steps per color channel.
- Half precision numbers can have pretty much any value, but they loose precision the further away the value is from 0. Half precision values are great for storing colors that need more range/precision (if we render HDR colors, we should use half) or to store short vectors like normals.
- Floating point numbers technically have double the precision of half numbers, that means they are more accurate, especially for high numbers. They are usually used to store positions.

```glsl
int integer; //number without fractional component
fixed fixed_point; //fixed point number between -2 and 2
half low_precision; //low precision number
float high_precision; //high precision number
```

### Vector Types
Then there are vector values based on the scalar ones. With vector values we can represent things like colors, positions and directions that have multiple values in a variable. To declare them in HLSL we just write the number of dimensions we need at the end of the type, so we get types like float2, int3, half4 etc.. (Note that the maximum here is 4 dimensions, for more you have to use arrays, we won’t get into them here, but if you know arrays from other languages be told that they are a bit messy in hlsl)

### Matrix Types
Also there are the matrix types which are basically a field of numbers. They are used to convert the vectors from one “space” to another. I will explain them when they become important. You can create matrices by writing [dimension 1]x[dimension 2] behind a scalar type, for example half3x3, int2x4 or float4x4.

### Samplers
There are also samplers which are used to read from textures. When reading from samplers the texture has coordinates from [0,0] to [1,1], 0,0 being the lower left corner and 1,1 being the upper right corner of the texture.

### Structs
Finally there are structs, custom datatypes which can hold several other datatypes. We can represent lights, input data and other complex data with structs. To use a struct we first have to define it, then we can use it somewhere else.

## Functions
All instructions in hlsl are written in functions. Before a function can be called, it has to be defined somewhere else in the shader.
We write the variable type that is returned by the function in front of the name, the return type can also be void, which means that the function doesn’t return a value. Behind the function name we put the arguments, which is data the function recieves. And in the function we return the value which is then given to the function which called this function.

## Include files
You can write code in one file and then include it into others. It works as if the content of the included file was in the file that’s including it at the place the include command stands. The syntax for including files is
```glsl
#include “IncludeFile.cginc”
```
All shader files, including include files can include other files. Include files are mostly used as libraries or to split big shaders into multiple files.
