Hey there, I'm Ronja and I make shader tutorials with the goal to make shaders understandable by everyone. 
The focus of this tutorials is on unity shaders with hlsl because they are more accessible than direct implementations of the shader APIs yet flexible and powerful.
I try to make a new tutorial every week so the list of tutorials is growing quickly. If you have any wishes for shaders you want to know how they work write me a message and I'll see what I can do.

If you like what I do and want to support me you can do that on Ko-Fi: <https://ko-fi.com/axoila>.
